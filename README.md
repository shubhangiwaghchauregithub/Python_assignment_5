Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
This part of the program demonstrates how to use a Python dictionary to store and retrieve student marks:

A dictionary called student_marks is created, where each key is a student's name and the value is their marks.

The user is prompted to enter a student's name.

The program checks if the entered name exists in the dictionary:

If found, it prints the student's marks.

If not found, it prints "Student not found."

This is a basic example of how dictionaries can be used for quick lookups based on a key (in this case, the student's name).


Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
This part of the program shows how to use list slicing in Python:

A list called numbers is created with values from 1 to 10.

The first five elements are extracted using slicing (numbers[:5]).

These extracted elements are then reversed using slicing with a step of -1 (first_five[::-1]).

The program prints the original list, the first five elements, and the reversed version of those elements.
